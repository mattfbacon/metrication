# Metrication

A Firefox addon to automatically convert measurements to standard units on the web.
Tries its best to not be annoying but due to natural language ambiguity there are always some mistakes.

## Usage

```shell
./build.sh
zip -r /tmp/package.zip manifest.json icons out
# Load /tmp/package.zip as an addon
```
